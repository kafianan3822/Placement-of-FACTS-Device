# Placement-of-FACTS-Device
Investigated using a GIPFC (FACTS device) in MATLAB to improve voltage stability and power flow in an overloaded IEEE-30 bus network. Developed a general-purpose MATLAB code solving power flow equations for any n-bus system, enabling analysis of diverse network configurations.
